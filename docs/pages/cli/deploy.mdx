# `hybrid deploy`

Deploys your contract to main or test blockchains. This will automatically write the proper configuration, there is no need to set any address or ABIs manually.

> Note - Make sure to set `HYBRID_ENV` variable in order to tell Hybrid to use the correct deployment stage.

### Usage

Deploy contracts/MyNFT.sol to the corresponding testnet:

```sh
hybrid deploy MyNFT test
```

and then set `HYBRID_ENV=test`

Deploy contracts/MyNFT.sol to mainnet:

```sh
hybrid deploy MyNFT prod
```

and then set `HYBRID_ENV=prod`
