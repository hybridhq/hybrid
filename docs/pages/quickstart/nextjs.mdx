# Next.js Quickstart

This quick start walks you step-by-step through everything you need to get started. It'll take approximately 5 minutes.

Let's get started.

## 1. Install hybrid

```sh
npx hybrid init
```

You'll be asked which blockchain you want to use. Hybrid supports many EVM-based blockchains:

- <a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank">
  	Ethereum
  </a>
- <a href="https://polygon.technology/" target="_blank">
  	Polygon
  </a>
- <a href="https://arbitrum.io/" target="_blank">
  	Arbitrum
  </a>
- <a href="https://www.optimism.io/" target="_blank">
  	Optimism
  </a>
- <a href="https://base.org/" target="_blank">
  	Base
  </a>

We're adding more Chains soon. Feel free to request new chains in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AcJFXZ9Mfk" target="_blank">Support room on Discord</a>.

## 2. Add Web3Provider

Add the `<Web3Provider>` component to `pages/_app.tsx`

```tsx
import { Web3Provider } from "hybrid"

const App = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
	return (
		<Web3Provider>
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</Web3Provider>
	)
}

export default App
```

## 3. Use hybrid in your React components

Add the following to your `./pages/index.tsx` file:

```tsx
import { WriteButton } from "hybrid"
import { Deployments } from "../.hybrid/client"

export default function Home() {
	return (
		<div>
			<WriteButton contract={Deployments.MyNFT} />
		</div>
	)
}
```

To learn more about `<WriteButton>`, go to the [WriteButton](/docs/components/WriteButton) docs.

## 4. Run Hybrid locally

```sh
hybrid dev
```

This runs Hybrid locally. We'll use this to test our smart contracts and frontend components as we write them.

See the [hybrid dev docs](/docs/cli#dev) for more information.

## 5. Run Next.js

Run Next.js like you would normally `next dev`.
