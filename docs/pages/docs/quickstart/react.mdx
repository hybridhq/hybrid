# React Quickstart

This quick start walks you step-by-step through everything you need to get started. It'll take approximately 5 minutes.

Let's get started.

## 1. Install hybrid

```sh
npx hybrid init
```

## 2. Add the Web3Provider

Add the `<Web3Provider>` component to `src/index.js` file.

```jsx
import { Web3Provider } from "hybrid"

root.render(
	<React.StrictMode>
		<Web3Provider>
			<App />
		</Web3Provider>
	</React.StrictMode>
)
```

## 4. Use hybrid in your React components

Add the following to your `./pages/index.tsx` file:

```tsx
import { MintButton } from "hybrid"
import { Deployments } from "~/.hybrid/client"

export default function Home() {
	return (
		<div>
			<MintButton contract={Contracts.MyNFT} />
		</div>
	)
}
```

To learn more about `<MintButton>`, go to the [MintButton](/docs/components/MintButton) docs.

## 2. Run Hybrid locally

```sh
hybrid dev
```

This runs Hybrid locally. We'll use this to test our smart contracts and frontend components as we write them.

See the [hybrid dev docs](/docs/cli#dev) for more information.

## 5. Run `npm start`

Starts the development server like you would normally.
