# hybrid CLI

## [hybrid dev](#dev)

Starts Hybrid in development mode.

### Usage

hybrid dev

Hybrid will watch your contracts directory for changes and re-complile and re-deploy your contracts as needed.

<a name="deploy" />

## [hybrid deploy](#deploy)

Deploys your contract to main or test blockchains. This will automatically write the proper configuration, there is no need to set any address or ABIs manually.

```sh
hybrid deploy MyNFT test
```

and then set `HYBRID_ENV=test`

Deploy contracts/MyNFT.sol to mainnet:

hybrid deploy MyNFT prod
```

and then set `HYBRID_ENV=prod`
