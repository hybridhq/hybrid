# Smart Contracts

Hybrid uses <a href="https://book.getfoundry.sh/" target="_blank">Foundry</a> for contract compiliation. While there were a few choices here, including writing from scratch, the toolset that Foundry offers is superb.

One of the main advantages of Foundry is that all tests are written in Solidity (versus JavaScript). This let's a developer work exclusively in Solidity for both smart contract development AND testing.

Hybrid stores all contracts in `./contracts`.

```ml
./contracts
├─ MyContract.sol - Your main solidity contract
├─ MyContract.test.sol - Tests for your solidity contract
```

## Using separate contracts/src and contracts/test directories.

Lots of developers like to separate contract source files from test files.

To do this, edit your `foundry.toml` file and change:

```toml
src = './contracts'
test = './contracts'
```

to

```toml
src = './contracts/src'
test = './contracts/test'
```
