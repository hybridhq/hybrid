# Deployments

Hybrid will manage all your deployment configurations for you - no configuration files are necessary to maintain.

To deploy to testnet or mainnet, run:

```sh
hybrid deploy NFT test
```

Once you have deployed the contract, hybrid will write the necessary deployment configurations to your hybrid config directory, default location is `./.hybrid`

```sh
❯ hybrid deploy NFT test
⠹ Waiting for deployment in browser ...
```

When you run `hybrid deploy ContractName <stage>`, hybrid will open a browser to proceed with the contract deployment.

From here, use any wallet you'd like to deploy the contract. No more managing private keys from the command line!

After the contract is deployed, hybrid will automatically update your deployment configuration.

```sh

## Choosing a Deployment Stage

By default, hybrid will use:

### In Production

For production environments (i.e. when `NODE_ENV` === "production"), hybrid will determine the stage from:

- The value of `HYBRID_ENV` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_HYBRID_ENV`
- If no value set, `prod` chain.

### In Development

- The value of `HYBRID_ENV` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_HYBRID_ENV`
- If no value set, `local` testnet node (i.e. `http://localhost:8545`)

## Deploying to Testnet

Based on your choice of blockchain during initialization, hybrid will use the testnet version of the chain for deployment.

To deploy:

```
hybrid deploy <contract> test
```

Then set `HYBRID_ENV=test` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_HYBRID_ENV=test` in your `.env` file or on your hosting provider's Environment Variables.

## Deploying to Mainnet

To deploy:

```
hybrid deploy <contract> prod
```

In most cases, no configuration in production is necessary. Depending on your hosting provider you might have to set `HYBRID_ENV=prod` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_HYBRID_ENV=prod` environment variables to force hybrid to use production.
