# Next.js Quickstart

This quick start walks you step-by-step through everything you need to get started. It'll take approximately 5 minutes. You will learn how to:

- Install and run MintDrop on your machine for local testing
- Add MintDrop to an existing Next.js project (other frameworks are also supported)
- Write and compile your first smart contract
- Call functions on your smart contradct from your React components
- Deploy your smart contract to blockchain mainnet or testnet.

Let's get started.

## 1. Install MintDrop

```sh
npx create mintdrop
```

## 2. Run MintDrop locally

```sh
mint dev
```

This runs MintDrop locally. We'll use this to test our smart contracts and frontend components as we write them.

With this running you can visit [http://localhost:8500](http://localhost:8500) to see the development UI.

See the [mint dev docs](/docs/cli/dev) for more information.

## 3. Add the MintDropProvider wrapper

Add the `<MintDropProvider>` component to `pages/_app.tsx`

```tsx
import { Web3Provider } from "@mintdrop/sdk"

const App = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
	return (
		<Web3Provider>
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</Web3Provider>
	)
}

export default App
```

## 4. Add your first React component

Let's write your first reliable serverless function! Add the following to your `./pages/index.tsx` file:

```tsx
import { MintWidget } from "mintdrop/react"

export default function Home() {
	const handleMinted = (nft) => {
		console.log("nft", nft)
	}

	return (
		<div>
			<MintWidget onMinted={handleMinted} />
		</div>
	)
}
```

To see all React components, go to the [Components](/docs/components) section.

## 5. Run Next.js

Run Next.js like you would normally `next dev`.
